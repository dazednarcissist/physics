# Physics while @ Home

Physics projects done while @ Home during lockdown and unemployment.

## Description

So far a double-springed pendulum and a triple pendulum has been done. Based on Mr. P Solver's video on a double-springed pendulum (linked below). For the double-springed pendulum, the code was modified to use different masses for each bob, and adding a tracer for the second bob.
